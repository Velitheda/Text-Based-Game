Text-Based-Game
===============

A text-based game inspired by Zork

This game is written in Java and currently is more of a generic engine that takes in a map presented in two text files that the program reads into a graph and lets the player navigate by typing compass directions or up/down, and 'look' if lost.  

There is a limited ability for conversation with dialogue trees where the player can encourage more conversation by repeating the correct word in the dialogue given. The dialogue and the conversation structure is also read in through a text file.  

Currently the ability to fight is not properly implimented yet.
